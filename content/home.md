This is the person blog of Zhijun. I am a postdoctoral researcher at [UCD](https://www.ucd.ie).\

My research interest is Food authenticity. The combination of Analysis technology (hyperspectral imaging, isotope analysis, gas mass spectrometry) and Machine learning based on R/Python/Matlab are used to evaluate the linkage of growing conditions and food quality. Here you can find my research [papers](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Zhijun-Wang-18).\

Now I am looking for work opportunity in the Netherlands.

My research interest is Food Science, food fraud, data science. 

- **Lab work**: Near infrared spectroscopy, Hyperspectral imaging, Isotope analysis, high performance liquid chromatographyï¼ŒMass spectrometry, etc
- **Data visualization**: bar chart, heatmap, scatter plot, etc using R, PowerBI
- **Data analysis**: data cleaning, data preprocessing
- **Machine learning**: PCA, Random Forest, SVM, Neural Network, etc using Python, R
- **Project management**: meeting, report, presentation, teamplayer

Looking for: Data visualization, analyst, research scientist, etc\

Besides of research work, I also enjoyed in education activities for Undergraduate and master courses.\

I have been active as a teaching assistant for many years.\

I am also a Social media manager for my personal channel [SCI_code], which has more than 30k followers.\
