### Hi there, welcome to my blog! 👋

- 🌾 I’m a PhD Candidate of Food Authenticity and Nutrition at Wageningen Univeristy & Research.

- 👨‍💻 I have been working with the Food Science and Data Science since 2017, during this time I worked with a variety of mass spectrometry, spectral analysis techniques, regression and classification models.

- 🌏 I believe that digital transformation is one of the trends in building sustainable agricultural and food systems.
