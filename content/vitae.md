### Hi there, welcome to my blog! 👋

- 🌾 I’m a PhD Candidate of Food Authenticity and Nutrition at Wageningen Univeristy & Research.

- 👨‍💻 I have been working with the Food Science and Data Science since 2017, during this time I worked with a variety of mass spectrometry, spectral analysis techniques, regression and classification models.

- 🌏 I believe that digital transformation is one of the trends in building sustainable agricultural and food systems.

### 🍌Research Interest

Food fraud, food safety, data chemomentrics, big data analysis in foods

### 👩‍🏫Education Background

* 2017-Now, PhD. in Food Fraud and Authentication, Wageningen University & Research, the Netherlands

* 2014-2017, Msc in Food Science, Nanchang University, China

* 2011-2013, Second Bsc in Economics, Nanchang University, China

* 2010-2014, Bsc in Food Science, Nanchang University, China

### 💪Research experience

* **Hyperspectral imaging (HSI)** and **Near infrared spectroscopy (NIR)** for geographical origin and organic certification of food

* Multiple mass spectrometry techniques such as **GC-MS**, **ICP-MS**, **IR-MS**, **DART-HR-MS** to explore the compositional characteristics of food

* Nutrition evaluation of food for Animal/Human by **Cell Culture** and **animal model**

### ⚒️Data science experiences

  I am writing a **Data Science Cookbook in Food Application** to summary the necessary data techniques in food science, you can find the [**digital version here**](https://github.com/ZhijunWang1991/Machine-learning-Report/blob/main/Data-Science-Cookbook-in-Food-Application.pdf). R is my main programming language. The most of experiences is to built **predicted models** for the geographical origins of my samples based on NIR spectral, chemical compositions, HSI image features using Principal component analysis (PCA), Partial Least-Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA), random forest (RF) and other Machine Learning algorithms. 
  
* *Data Visualization* with R: Scatter plot, boxplot, heatmap, etc.

* *Regression modelling*: Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, prediction based on regression models.

* *Principal component analysis* (PCA) from computing to visualizations.

* *Classification model*: PLS-DA, ANN, random forest  and other Machine learning algorithms.

* I am also learning *Python* and *Matlab* for image analysis;
